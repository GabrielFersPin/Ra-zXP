# 🎮 InnerLevel – Personal Gamification Tracker

**InnerLevel** is a personal gamification system I created to stay motivated while building habits and searching for my first job in data science. It’s designed for people who take non-traditional paths, learn independently, and value progress that isn’t always linear.

## 🚀 What does this app do?

- Track professional and personal tasks
- Assign custom points to actions (like publishing on LinkedIn or completing a job application)
- Log and review daily/weekly progress
- Visualize your journey in a motivating, simple interface
- Build your own reward system (interviews = bonus points!)

## 💡 Why I built it

This app keeps me grounded. It shows me that I’m moving, even when the world feels silent.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) – for fast interactive UI
- Python 3.9+
